# ao-localnet

Run a complete [AO Computer](http://ao.computer/) testbed, locally, with Docker Compose.

## Purpose

The repo may helpful if you are doing one or more of the following:

1. Contributing to [@permaweb/ao](https://github.com/permaweb/ao).
1. Compiling `ao` modules using the `ao` [dev-cli](https://github.com/permaweb/dev-cli).
   - And you want to avoid publishing each revision onto Arweave mainnet.
1. You are developing an `ao` component (e.g. a `cu`, `mu`, or `su`).
   - And you want to plug that into a working environment.
1. You are developing Lua code that will be loaded into `aos` processes.
   - And you want to avoid bricking your `aos` processes on `ao` testnet.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone this repo.
1. Setup the necessary Arweave wallets:
    1. `cd` into the `wallets` directory (at the root of this repo).
    1. Run `generateAll.sh` to create new wallets for everything.
        - _See [wallets/README.md](wallets/README.md) for more details._
    1. Run `printWalletAddresses.mjs` to list the addresses. _(Useful for step 4, below.)_
1. Boot up the localnet:
    1. Run `docker compose up --detach`.
        - _You will need to have the Docker daemon running._
        - _This could take a while the first time you run it._
      - You will have many services now bound to ports in the 4000 range (all subject to change):
          - http://localhost:4000/ - ArLocal (Arweave gateway/mock)
          - http://localhost:4007/ - A simple Arweave bundler/uploader
          - http://localhost:4004/ - An `ao` compute unit (`cu`).
          - http://localhost:4002/ - An `ao` messenger unit (`cm`).
          - http://localhost:4003/ - An `ao` schedule unit (`su`).
1. Seed data onto the blockchain:
    1. `cd` into the `seed` directory (at the root of this repo).
    1. Run `./download-aos-module.sh` to pull a WASM binary from testnet.
    1. Set your wallet addresses _(from step 2, above)_ in `./seed-for-aos.sh`, then run it.
1. Run `aos`:
    1. `cd` into the `aos` directory (at the root of this repo).
    1. Run `./aos`.

## Additional Services

> [!NOTE]
> You can optionally enable the following services.
> Powered by [Docker Compose profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/)

- ScAR (Arweave block explorer):
  - Run `docker compose --profile explorer up`.
  - http://localhost:4006/
- ArDrive Web:
  - Run `docker compose --profile ardrive up`.
  - http://localhost:4001/
- Turbo Upload Service (an Arweave uploader/bundlr):
  - Run `docker compose --profile turbo up`.
  - http://localhost:4005/ 
  - _Not fully functional. See below for more details._

## Development Status of this Repo

> [!WARNING]
> `ao` and `aos` are have just started working, but configuration (such as port mappings) will change soon
> and more usability features are planned.

- ✅ ArLocal instance mocking Arweave and acting as Arweave gateway.
  - ℹ️ There are some features missing from [the upstream](https://github.com/textury/arlocal)
    that tend to be used by block explorers, so we are using
    [this fork](https://github.com/MichaelBuhler/arlocal), which fixes:
    - ✅ Added `GET /tx/pending` to fetch pending transaction ids
    - ✅ Added `GET /raw/:txid` to download raw transaction data
    - ✅ Fix some bugs in chunk uploading/downloading
    - ⬜ Blocks don't include `block_size` ([#1](https://github.com/MichaelBuhler/arlocal/issues/1))
    - ⬜ Blocks don't include `reward_addr` ([#3](https://github.com/MichaelBuhler/arlocal/issues/3))
    - ⬜ Blocks don't include `weave_size` ([#2](https://github.com/MichaelBuhler/arlocal/issues/2))
- ✅ Arweave block explorer (web interface).
  - ✅ ScAR - A lightweight option from [here](https://github.com/renzholy/scar),
    forked [here](https://github.com/MichaelBuhler/scar), with improvements.
  - ⬜ ArweaveWebWallet - Another option from [here](https://github.com/jfbeats/ArweaveWebWallet)
    which powers https://arweave.app/.
- ✅ Fully functional `ao` computer, using the
  [reference implementations](https://github.com/permaweb/ao/servers).
  - ✅ `cu`
  - ✅ `mu`
  - ✅ `su`
- ✅ Successfully launching `aos` processes on the `ao` localnet.
- ⬜ Live reloading for `cu` and `mu` development.
  - _A cool [feature](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/develop/) of Docker Compose._
- ⬜ nginx reverse proxy, for hostname routing
  - Currently in testing. [This](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxproxy/nginx-proxy) looks promising.
- ⬜ DNS routing
  - ✅ Routing `*.ao-localnet.xyz` to `127.0.0.1` and `::1`
  - ℹ️ All containers should be reachable via `*.ao-localnet.xyz` domain names.
- ⚠️ Fully functional ArDrive Web (web interface)
  - ℹ️ Two minor issues remaining:
    - ⏳ Waiting on [this issue](https://github.com/ardriveapp/arweave-dart/issues/59), which causes ArDrive
      Web to makes calls the Arweave gateway on the wrong port.
      - ✅ Scheduled for [the next release (v3.8.4)](https://github.com/ardriveapp/arweave-dart/pull/61).
    - ⚠️ ArDrive Web is using so-called "sandboxed urls" where it contacts the gateway on a subdomain that is
      the base32 encoded transaction id of the Arweave transaction.
      - _This can be mitigated by adding `127.0.0.1 *.localhost` to your `/etc/hosts` file._
      - _Possibly can be fixed with DNS routing, see above._
